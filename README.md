## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Required libraries are Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and sklearn. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The project is run as part of Udacity Nanodegree for Data science certificate program. I used Stack Overflow data from 2024 survey to understand:
1. What factors contribute to high job satisfaction among developers?
2. Are more experienced developers generally happier in their roles?
3. Can a decision tree classifier accurately predict a developer’s job satisfaction score?
4. Can a machine learning model predict a respondent’s age based on their survey answers?

   
The raw data is owned by Stack Overflow:https://survey.stackoverflow.co/.
The analysis is inspired and guided by the Udacity nano degree for data science course. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The project contains 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions:
'Survey_data2' contains the selected columns from the survey results.
'Project_DS.ipynb' is the code with the analysis and the model.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The summary of the analysis is available at the git hub post [here](https://medium.com/@new_to_data_science/decoding-developer-job-satisfaction-insights-from-stack-overflows-2024-survey-1dd9d5ae4c64).
